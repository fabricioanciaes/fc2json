FRM JSON PACK - 06/21/2022 (V9)
We are back again
- New server (Thanks @noksookhao!)
............................................................................................................

FRM JSON PACK - 01/04/2022 (V8)
- Fixed puyofev chd files and puyoda save state on flycast (Thanks Xkower8181)
- Fixed monkeyba (Thanks Xkower8181)
- Updated some fbneo hacks: msvsfbh, mvscbh, sfa3sp2, mshbh, vampjbh, vsavae, xmcotabh (thanks Tobemorecrazy)

............................................................................................................
FRM JSON PACK - 11/02/2021 (V7)
Now the json file downloads the save files for flycast games (around 46 games are in the list) straight from the
github flycast community save file github repository (https://github.com/blueminder/flycast-netplay-savestates) (thanks blueminder)

I also found out that the order you put them in the required array DOES matter lol. Save states werent being downloaded on the /data/
folder the first time you booted the game if you listed a CHD file before the save state requirement. It seems to be a FRM bug.

Added Vigilante 8 2nd offense to flycast games too.

FRM JSON Pack - 9/7/2021 (v5)
Biggest Update ever, after a few days of non-stop working, all games were reuploaded to a better server
(thanks tobemorecrazy!) and some json files even made from scratch

- All games were reuploaded
- Quicker downloads
- All flycast naomi and atomiswave games should work
- Preemptive support for upcoming external save states (Getting ready for Flycast GGPO)
- NES roms will be fixed in a future update (thats on frm side)

I also made a ko-fi page if for some reason you want to support me, although I encourage you to
support the fightcade devs, flyinghead (flycast dev) and blueminder (flycast-dojo dev) first!

https://ko-fi.com/lofi1048

Please report the games that arent working through a dm on twitter (@lofi1048)
I need to figure out a better way to keep track of this lol.

- Fixed some SNES games:
	- samshou.zip
	- samspir.zip
	- sf2tua.zip
	- sf2u.zip
	- ssf2u.zip

- Added the latest version of SF2MIX directly from their download link, it should always grab the latest rom

- Added sfa3aism.zip, a sfa3 hack that is A-ISM locked, its not yet supported by FC2 as of this release.
  but maybe in the next fc2 updates it will be added as a room.

Shoutouts to tobemorecrazy and o-range for testing some corrupted games.
